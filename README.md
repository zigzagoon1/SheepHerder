# SheepHerder
Sheep Herder game scripts

This is a learning project I've been working on. Eventually I hope it will be a complete game, but I do use it to learn various techniques in some cases (eg. grass shaders!).
Any advice or suggestions for improvements and optimizations are appreciated. 

Please be aware, I work on things a little haphazardly, and my commits may only have small changes sometimes. As this is a solo project, and I am trying to build a portfolio of my work, I feel it is more important to commit updates and refactoring to show improvements, and the code is not necessarily representative of the finished work at this time.
